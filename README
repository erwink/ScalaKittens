In this project I plan to keep small solutions that are free to grab and too small for building a "library".
Scala kittens (https://docs.google.com/present/view?id=dc7rg5cv_76d7dpx5c5&revision=_latest&start=0&theme=blank&cwj=true&pli=1)
has example of this stuff, one-liners. Probably they deserve to be put to gist.

Anyway, currently it's just Caching that is present here.
